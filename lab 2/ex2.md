1. a) Better estimation of the target position;
   b) Interpolation search is adaptive to the distribution of the data, binary search assumes only uniform distributions.

2. If the data is not uniformly distributed, its performance may degrade since this estimate may be inaccurate, leading to more comparisons and thus a longer search tim.

3. pos = low + int(((float(high - low) / (arr[high] - arr[low])) * (x - arr[low])))
this line would be different, since this estimate the position of target value x based on the assumption that the array is uniformly distributed.

4. when no knowledge of data organization or distribution is assumed, 

5. For very small arrays (e.g., less than 10 elements), calculating midpoints in binary search might be more complecated, making linear search slightly faster in those cases.

6. Hybrid Search: For small arrays, a hybrid approach can be used where binary or interpolation search is used until a certain level, and then it switches to linear search when the size of the subarray being searched becomes smaller than a certain threshold
