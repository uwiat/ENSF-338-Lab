1) Algorithm to find room:
Following the room labels and directional arrows on the sign would be part of the algorithm. The algorithm would tell the user to proceed as directed from the current position (EY100) until they reached room EY128. Taking the sign as an example, the algorithm could say: "Go right to EY102, then go up to EY104, continue up to EY106, and so on until you reach EY128."

2) Number of "steps" to find room EY128:
The number of direction changes or movements required to get to EY128 would be the amount of "steps" In this case, each change in room label would be considered a step. One step would be moving from EY100 to EY102, and another would be moving from EY102 to EY104. So, to get to EY128 would require 15 steps.

3) Best-case, worst-case scenario, or neither: 
This is the worst case as you are going through 14 rooms to reach the room EY128 so total of 15 steps.



4) Worst-case or best-case:

Worst-case scenario: The worst-case scenario could involve a complex path, where the person has to go through multiple rooms before reaching EY128 that would be 15 steps.

Best-case scenario: The best-case scenario would be a straightforward path, with clear directions, where the person can reach EY128 quickly and directly that would be 6 steps.

5) Improving the algorithm after memorizing the floor layout: After you memorizing the floor layout you can use the arrow all other rooms to reach the room EY128 quicker and faster which is only 6 steps than to take the EY 100-130 route which is 15 steps.
