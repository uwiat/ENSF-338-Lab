Exercise 6.1
The differnce between arrayas and linked lists:
Arrays:
-Random Access: allows us to access any element through an index, making them highly efficient for tasks accessing elements frequently.
-Memory efficiency: Arrays are very space efficient for storing elements of the same data type and especially when the size is known in advance and is static.



Linked lists:
-A dynamic size: linked lists are dynamic data structures that can easily grow or shrink, the allocate and deallocation of nodes

- Randomo Access: Access elements ar a specific position requires traversing the list from the beginning to the desired position so you cannot accesss specific elements without going through the whole list first.
